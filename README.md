# taskly
A simple project/task management built with React and Firebase

## About
Taskly is a simple project/task management system I built to better familiarize myself with Firebase as well as some of React's advanced concepts (e.g., context). Upon successful login or signup, user can create project(s) and add tasks that are each optionally tagged with a due date. There are three "constant" projects, <em>Due today</em>, <em>Due within 7 days</em>, and <em>All incomplete tasks</em>, for a quick glance-through of the user's existing tasks.

## Stack
- React and Material UI for the front-end design and dev
- Firebase auth for setting up and managing user accounts
- Firestore database for storing and querying data
